                		<p>Stacy Springer has worked for philanthropic, non-profit agencies since 1993. A graduate from UC Davis with a major in English and an emphasis in Japanese, Stacy’s interests initially led her to the field of education where she worked first as a teacher abroad and, ultimately, as the Admissions Director for an international private school in Florida. Stacy learned that the funding needs of most education institutions, both public and private, were great and not always supported by tuition or tax dollars. She began organizing fundraising events to help procure facilities and services for the schools in which she worked. Moving back to Sacramento in 2007 Stacy became involved in her three children’s elementary school, fundraising to provide the school’s classrooms with cutting edge white board technology. From there Stacy’s path took a turn to environmental non-profit where she worked five years for the American River Parkway Foundation organizing fundraising events and managing volunteer programs along the parkway. Native to Sacramento, Stacy grew up enjoying the parkway and was thrilled to now have the opportunity to manage programs dedicated to preserving ‘Sacramento’s Jewel’. Organizing biking, running and other parkway events, Stacy was introduced to another side of non-profit—the health side. As many of her volunteers were parkway users, enjoying the outdoors for health reasons, Stacy developed an interest in the marriage between health and the environment. As a senior manager now at BREATHE, and the coordinator for their largest annual fundraiser, the Breathe Bike Trek, Stacy continues to use her fundraising and program management skills to forward BREATHE’s philanthropic goal of clean air, healthy lungs and tobacco free living. Her greatest joy is working with outdoor enthusiasts who are committed to improving our region’s quality of life.</p>
